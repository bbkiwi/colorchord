<h3>Note from music are selected and displayed via LEDs in various ways.</h3>
<p>Sound is sampled by ADC at around 20KHz.(Still problems
with running fast ADC and wifi. Output is slightly jittery
and range which should be 0 to 255 is restricted.)
</p>
<p>A Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is adjusted via
 parameters gDFTIIR, gFUZZ_IIR_BITS (high attenuates high and low), gFILTER_BLUR_PASSES and
gSEMIBITSPERBIN. It is wrapped to give a histogram of intensities over rMAXNOTES. </p>
<p>Two amplitudes amp1 and amp2 are used which decay at different rates. Those with amp1 above gMIN_AMP_FOR_NOTE become notes. </p>
<p>gAMP_1_IIR_BITS and gAMP_2_IIR_BITS control decay speed
of the two amplitudes amp1 and amp2.  Lower values give slow decay.</p>
<p>NOTE Lower gAMP_1_IIR_BITS &#60; 3 freezes and then
comes back resetting its value.  </p>
<p>Notes last until amp1 decays below 	gMINIMUM_AMP_FOR_NOTE_TO_DISAPPEAR</p>
<p>Notes persist if the frequency does not change too much but are considered new if change by more than
gMAX_JUMP_DISTANCE and 	gMAX_COMBINE_DISTANCE control this.</p>
<p>NOTE_FINAL_AMP and NOTE_FINAL_SATURATION determine overall LED display brightness and saturation.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>The selected notes can be displayed on a ring of gNUM_LIN_LEDS LEDs in various ways.<br>
      A linear array of gUSE_NUM_LIN_LEDS LEDs is inserted in the rings depending on gCOLORCHORD_OUTPUT_DRIVER value</dt>
  <dd>- 0 (see embeddedcommon/embeddedout.c UpdateLinearLEDs) - The note colors are displayed as bands with size proportional to amp1<br>
 Color them according to note_peak_freq with brightness related to amps2</dd>
  <dd>- 1 - The dominant note colors the complete interval</dd>
  <dd>- 2 - Check it is pretty similar to 0 now.</dd>
  <dd>- 3 - Pattern indepenent of sound</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>The linear array can be rotated optionally in the ring</dt>
  <dd>- Every gCOLORCHORD_SHIFT_INTERVAL frames shift (0 no shift, 1 fast, higher values go slower</dd>
  <dd>- by gCOLORCHORD_SHIFT_DISTANCE (larger values appear faster but also discrete effects if divisor of ring size.</dd>
  <dd>- Change shift direction on peak of amp2 if gCOLORCHORD_FLIP_ON_PEAK = 1</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Control of band order</dt>
  <dd>- gCOLORCHORD_SORT_NOTES (0 no sort, 1 inc freq, 2 dec amps, 3 dec amps2)</dd>
  <dd>- gCOLORCHORD_LIN_WRAPAROUND (0 no adjusting, else current led display has minimum deviation to prev)</dd>
  <dd>- gROOT_NOTE_OFFSET (A produces peak at left side of DFT histogram. This is colored yellow if Offset is 0)<br>
        .... NOTERANGE/12 gives offset for one semitone making G# have yellow. There are FIXBPERO colors per octave. Using offset 
        of Color Number * NOTERANGE/FIXBPERO will start with this color. To set a given note to a specific color for example
        with offset 0 B is red, to make C red use 11*NOTERANGE/12</dd>
</dl>

 <dl>
  <dt>Sound fed to ADC and monitored by Oscilloscope</dt>
  <dd>- Bias of VCC/2.</dd>
  <dd>- Scale (using nodemcu is 0 to 3.3 V, but needs adjusting</dd>
  <dd>- Slider magnifies around VCC/2</dd>
