        Charles Lohr developed <a href="https://github.com/cnlohr/colorchord">Colorchord</a> in 2010. 
		He describes its features in this <a href="https://cnlohr.blogspot.com/2010/11/colorchord-sound-lighting.html">blog article</a>.

   <h3 id=backgr>Background</h3>
  <div>On branch <b>newfeatures</b> of <a href="https://github.com/bbkiwi/colorchord">my fork of colorchord</a> using branch <b>tmp</b> of <a href="https://github.com/bbkiwi/esp82xx">my fork of  esp82xx</a>  has extended the control gui and added many 
	LED display features.
	Parameters control behavior. The Gui allows adjustment of key 
	parameters via sliders. Parameters are stored in FLASH (initally as defaults) so persist between restarts (if the number of LEDs is changed and code recompiled, the
	stored configuration specifying how many LEDs to use will NOT change).

   <h3 id=backgr>Mathematical Parameters</h3>
  <div>Certain parameters specified at compile time determine the mathematical set up:  
  BASE_FREQ gives the lowest frequency to be monitored, DFREQ the sample rate for the ADC, OCTAVES the number of octaves, and FIXBPERO the number of bins per octave. Their values can be seen in the parameter table.<br><br>
</div>
<div>Infinite Impulse Response filters: Output = Output + alpha*(Input - Output). Are used extensively and alpha of form 1/2^K implemented via K bit shifting.

   <ul>
   	<li>System
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Show Websocket messages/sec. 
		<li>Pushed: Gives total messages. Signal strength and IP number. 
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Oscilloscope<br>
	The microphone signal is biased at about 1.65V to generate an ADC reading of 127. Ideally audio input  should range from 0 to 3.3V to give full 8 bit resolution.  DC is filtered from the signal, glitches caused by web-socket interference partial removed, and digitally amplified.  This is passed to the Discrete Fourier Transform section of the code. This input with the DC offset restored (and clipped between 0 and 255)) is displayed by the oscilloscope.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Slider controls multiplier and center for display.
		<li>The amplification faction is the displayed value divided by 8.

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>DFT - Bin Histograms and Controls<br>The bins for each octave are handled as follows. For the highest octave, N = 2<sup>(OCTAVES-1)</sup>*(DFT UPDATE) successive samples are used to compute FIXBPERO complex phasors. The phasors pass thru an IIR filter and their magnitudes give the output bin values. For the next lowest octave, samples are returned via a  FIR filter (at half the sample rate) and N/2 of these are used as above for the bins for that octave. The samples are: (x<sub>1</sub>+2x<sub>2</sub>+x<sub>3</sub>)/4, (x<sub>3</sub>+2x<sub>4</sub>+x<sub>5</sub>)/4, ... This pattern continues. N/4 filtered samples: (x<sub>2</sub>+2x<sub>3</sub>+2x<sub>4</sub>+2x<sub>5</sub>+x<sub>6</sub>)/8, (x<sub>6</sub>+2x<sub>7</sub>+...)/8, ... 
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Menu: DFT, Fuzzed, Clipped, Folded, Octaves and Max.
		<li>	DFT IIR controls via IIR filter reaction and delay time - 
				0 very fast, 5 middle, 10 very slow
		<li>	DFT UPDATE specifies how many sets of 2<sup>(OCTAVES-1)</sup> samples are used to update)
		<li>DFT fuzzed, the raw bins are clipped below a cutoff, adjusted to compensate for unequal frequency response of the audio circuit,  and IIR filtered to produce fuzzed bins<br>
		CUT slider moves blue cutoff level in the DFT display.<br> 
				IIR slider gives reaction and delay time to DFT input
		<li>DFT Folded: BLURS slider gives how many passes of running average.
				0 no smoothing, 5 lots of smoothing
				<li>Octaves histogram display total output in each octave
				<li>Max bins default to 1, but can be set by sweeping an audio tone over the whole frequency range when in EQUALIZER_SET mode. See parameter section. 
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>LEDs
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Estimates power assuming ESP8266 draws 100ma with no LED on.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Notes (discrete frequency tones dividing an octave into FIXBPERO parts)<br>
			They are created from peak frequencies of a minimum adjusted amplitude and further than a minimum jump tolerance from any existing notes.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	 
		</li><li>SEMIBITSPERBIN slider: log base 2 of granularity of tones.
			0 keeps the FIXBPERO parts, 3 subdivides in 8 parts
		</li><li>MAX Jump slider: in tenths of a semitone. Frequences within this 
			tolerance of an existing note are combined to the existing note.
		</li><li>MAX Combines: in tenths of semitone. NOT WORKING IN SENSIBLE WAY probably redundant.
		</li><li>AMP 1 and 2 ATTACK, DELAY and MULT sliders:
			MULT magnifies or attenuates amplitude which thru IIR filters
				strengthens (via ATTACK value) or weakens (via DECAY value).
		The resultant amp<sub>1</sub> is used for creation, destruction and computing proportions of display. Amp<sub>2</sub> is used for strength of display (either brightness or size)
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Parameters - can all be specified directly but many are controlled by sliders as above. Only those not covered by sliders are described.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		
		<li>ROOT_NOTE_OFFSET: Offset in tenths of semitone. Used for setting key of music being colored. A (440Hz) produces peak at left side of DFT folded
			histogram. This is colored yellow if offset is 0. So offset of 10
			will make G# yellow, offset of 110 will make A# yellow. C is
			9 semitones below A, so 90 will make C yellow.
		</li><li>EQUALIZER_SET: 0 normal use. If set to N, the next 256N samples will be used to 
		find maximum of each DFT bin. Should play sweep of total frequency. This is used to adjust input frequency response when making fuzzed bins which then make the folded bins. These values can be seen in the MAX display in the DFT section. They can be saved - see CONFIG_NUMBER parameter.
		</li><li>NOTE_FINAL_AMP: Used to scale output to LEDs and also sets absolute
			maximum. Gamma correction is applied, so
			127 is half a bright as 255 (but only about 1/5 the power). 
		</li><li>NOTE_FINAL_SATURATION: 255 most intense colors. 200 pastel. 0 always
			pure white.
		</li><li>NERF_NOTE_PORP: Determines how notes are displayed as intervals. For length
			proportional to amp, this is minimum percent that will show. So
			above 50 will only show  the largest amplitude note. If value exceeds 100, the
			excess determines how many of the top amplitude notes will show. When rainbow
			(option 254) is displayed this parameters gives percent of rainbow
			to show. 
		</li><li>USE_NUM_LIN_LEDS: The number of consecutive leds in a display block.  The block is inserted into the LEDs in various ways.
		</li><li>SYMMETRY_REPEAT: The LED block will be repeated as equally spaced 
			as possible the given number of times. 
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_ACTIVE: If non-zero will be active, otherwise only accepts 
			over wifi from remote colorchord sending to IP address.
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_OUTPUT_DRIVER: Specifies various ways notes get mapped to 
			LEDs in the block. Each note gets an interval of LEDs.<br>
			Even: The number of LEDs for the note is in proportion to its amp<sub>1</sub>.<br>
			Odd: The number of LEDs is proportional to the number of notes. So
				if 3 notes are selected, they each get one third of the number
				of LEDs used.<br>
			Their color relates to the notes frequency. The brightness and
				arrangement on the interval depend on the value of this parameter. 
			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li>0,1: brightness proportional to amplitude<sub>2</sub>
				</li><li>2,3: brightness fixed at NOTE_FINAL_AMP
					 length from start proportional to amplitude<sub>2</sub>
				</li><li>4,5: brightness fixed at NOTE_FINAL_AMP at one end 
					 fades over length from start proportional to amplitude<sub>2</sub>
				</li><li>6,7: brightness fixed at NOTE_FINAL_AMP in middle 
					 fadeS to brightness proportional to amplitude<sub>2</sub> at ends
				</li><li>8,9: brightness proportional to amplitude<sub>2</sub> at middle
					 fades by factor of 4 at ends
				</li><li>10,11: brightness fixed at NOTE_FINAL_AMP
					   width of middle interval proportional to amplitude<sub>2</sub>
				</li><li>12,13: brightness fixed at NOTE_FINAL_AMP on middle interval of
					   width proportional to to amplitude<sub>2</sub>, fades either side to 0			
				</li>
		</ul>
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_SHIFT_INTERVAL: 0 no shifting; N every Nth frame a shift
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_FLIP_ON_PEAK:
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li>0: no flipping; 
			</li><li>1: flip on peaks of octave_bins[0]; 
			</li><li>2: flip on peaks of octave_bins[1]; 
			</li><li>3: flip on sum of previous two etc. 
			</li><li>255 sum of total amplitude<sub>1</sub> of the notes. 
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_SHIFT_DISTANCE: the amount of shifting when done. 
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_SORT_NOTES: 
			0 none; 1 ascending freq, 2 descending amp 1; 3 descending amp 2  
		</li><li>COLORCHORD_LIN_WRAPAROUND: 
			1 minimizes freq deviation between frames. 
		</li><li>CONFIG_NUMBER: 0 .. 15 gives the index of 16 default and 16 stored configurations (initially same as defaults) in FLASH. 
			Specifying a CONFIG_NUMBER, changing parameters and pushing SAVE stores the configuration to flash. LOAD recalls the stored configuration. DEFAULT brings in the default (but does not erase saved configuration). When the Colorchord restarts the last configuration SAVEd will
			be used. For CONFIG_NUMBER outside this range, SAVE will save the values found when EQUALIZER_SET was bigger than zero, DEFAULT will restore them to all 1, LOAD will bring back saved configuration.  
		</li><li>The remaining values in the table starting with r can not be changed 
			during run time and were specified at compile time in user.conf
